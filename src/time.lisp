;;; This file defines routines for dealing with
;;; time quantities, intervals, and UNIX Epoch
;;; timestamps.
;;;
;;; Of particular interest are TIMER/SYNC and
;;; TIMER/ASYNC, two functions that take a delay
;;; quantity (specified in seconds) and a function
;;; and then alternate between delaying and
;;; calling that function.  The TIMER/SYNC variant
;;; runs in the foreground; TIME/ASYNC executes in
;;; a background thread.

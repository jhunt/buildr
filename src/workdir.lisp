;;; This file defines routines related to creating
;;; and disposing of temporary working directories
;;; on the filesystem, mostly so that we can clone
;;; upstream git repositories into them and then
;;; rm -rf them when we're through using them.
;;;
;;; Most people only care about the WITH-WORKDIR
;;; macro, which wraps an UNWIND-PROTECT and the
;;; setup / teardown calls.  It is similar in spirit
;;; to WITH-OPEN-FILE:
;;;
;;;    (with-workdir (dir)
;;;      (do-something-in dir))
